# Generation of a Synthetic Handwritten Bangla Compound Character Dataset using a Modified Conditional GAN Architecture

## Abstract :

Developing an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system for handwritten texts is a challenging research problem. Handwritten text can be largely different even for the same piece of texts since the writing style differs from person to person. On the other hand, for many regional languages, unavailability of the datasets having a large quantity of varied images is a hindrance for the research advancements. This is especially true for Bangla, which is the most widely spoken language of Bangladesh and the second most widely spoken language India. Only a few works have been proposed for Bangla handwritten basic character generation and almost none related to the generation of Bangla compound characters. To this end, in this work, a method for the generation of synthetic handwritten Bangla compound characters is proposed to alleviate this data scarcity. A generative adversarial network (GAN) based model is developed for this purpose taking inspiration from the recent Auxiliary Classifier GAN (AC-GAN) model. A novel dataset partitioning scheme is also developed for handwritten character related tasks to improve the performance of the model. The quality of generated samples is evaluated in terms of the Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID) metric. It is observed that the present model performs better in comparison to the basic GAN architecture. Sample dataset generated as a part of this work is publicly available at Google Drive.
